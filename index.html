    <h2>Study Hypothois</h2>
    <p>
      While the Starbucks app has many wonderful features we believe
      that the rewards system itself is greatly lacking. We think that
      by revamping the current system users will be more likely to return
      regularly. We would achieve this by adding additional options to 
      earn rewards and making the current stars system easier to understand.
    </p>
    <h2>Surveys and Interviews</h2>
    <p2>
      During the survey and interviews, we discovered that most customers
      have their dislike about the Starbucks app like only being able to get 
      stars when purchasing through the app. The customer does not like having
      to preload money onto the app to gain stars.
    </p2>
    <h2>Personas</h2>
    <p3>
      Layla likes to use the Starbucks app but does not like certain features of 
      it. She goes to Starbucks often enough to utilize the reward system to take 
      advantage of their deals and savings. She likes to use the app to gain stars 
      but does not like how the methods in gaining the stars are not very user friendly.
    </p3>
    <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
    <h2>Sketches</h2>
    <p4>
      When designing the early wireframes the research showed that users enjoyed how the 
      current app functioned in terms of usability. By integrating the new rewards 
      system within the app's current aesthetics the users will be able to enjoy a 
      seamless transition.
    </p4>
    <h2>Mobile Prototype</h2>
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p5>
      Users were able to quickly and effectively use the new rewards section of the app 
      with no errors. The users enjoyed the that they were able to quickly scan the QR 
      code from the app to earn points.
    </p5>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I really enjoyed working on this project. I learned a lot about integrating 
      new designs within a current application that users already know and love. 
      Shortly after working on this project, Starbucks released a new rewards system
       that allows you to also pay with different methods. While it is a well-loved 
       app it also has even more room for growth. Users would still like to see an 
       order-ahead feature and would allow them to set a time to pick up their coffee.
